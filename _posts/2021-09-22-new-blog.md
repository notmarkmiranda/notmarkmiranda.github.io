title: Oh hey there! Brand spankin' new blog
---

I'm not sure if this will take. I'm feel like I fall fairly in the middle of most people who try to start blogs, in that they start, write a lot at the beginning, then it falls by the wayside for several months or just eventually is stale.

I am not going to commit to writing at specific intervals or about specific topics. I may not even publish this for several years, but at the very least it will live on my local machine where I can just visit this and read things I've written in markdown files.

Here's a quick rundown of who I am:

- Mark Miranda (despite the name on this blog)
- I live in Longmont, Colorado
- I went to the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://www.turing.edu) in 2016
- I work as a Software Engineer for [Doximity](https://workat.doximity.com). (We're hiring and I can refer you)
